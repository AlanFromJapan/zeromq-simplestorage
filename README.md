# zeromq-simplestorage
A simple storage service to store and retrieve files with ZeroMQ. **No security at all, don't use outside home NW!**
I use it to push/pop files between services asynchonously within my home NW.

But if you have __within your home NW__, a need for a simple & anonymous storage-retrieve service, that should do the trick.
